# Bubble_Game

In this mini project, I have learned about Event bubbling  of javaScript.
Event bubbling: - Event bubbling in JavaScript is a behavior where an event starts from the target element (the deepest element where the event occurred) and then bubbles up (propagates) through its ancestors (like parent, grandparent, etc.) until it reaches the document object.
More practive on dom elements,event listner and handler in js.
